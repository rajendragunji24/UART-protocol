# UART-protocol
UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) is a serial communication protocol that transmits data bit by bit without a clock signal. It uses start, data, optional parity, and stop bits for synchronization. Commonly used for short-distance communication between microcontrollers and peripherals.
